# MLProject

Predicting stock prices has always been one of the most favourite and challenging topics for data scientists and students
alike. It is (almost!) impossible for us to accurately predict the changes in stock prices, but we can use current financial models or basic statistics to get atleast the most basic information and price trends by observing and analyzing the data from over the years.
This project is my first attempt at Machine Learning (and second attempt at Python!) and stocks(spooky...). This project is the most basic Trading Game(Yayy!). It attempts to predict prices into the future and users can carry out transactions based on the previous data in the form of a game. I have imported data from Quandl(https://www.quandl.com) and used sklearn(scikit-learn.org) for the Machine Learning algorithms. The file 'stockGame.py' loads a game and various transactions and profits(and losses...sad) can be made over the course of the game. 
It is a very nice and basic way for beginners in Finance to learn about Stocks, and in Computer Science/Engineering to begin with Python and Machine Learning.
I also have another file named 'Regression.py' which is a nice way to start off with Python and Statistics. It is the basic implementation of machine learning functions of Linear Regression, Coefficient of Difference and Prediction. 

**DISCLAIMER** Do not make any financial judgements or transactions based on the predictions. It can be highly inaccurate. Pleae use this for educational purposes only.
